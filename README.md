# face-emotions-detector
*A simple web-application that uses face API for detecting expressions of any face with a probability of accuracy.*

### Overview :-
So basically, I have implemented the JavaScript face-API and some pre-trained models for better accuracy. Allow camera access to the application, now it will try to capture your face.<br> [**TAP HERE, just make some expressions and enjoy the results!ðŸ¥³**](https://krishchopra22.github.io/face-emotions-detector/)
